Inverse problems play a central role across diverse fields, including medical imaging (CT, MRI), geophysical exploration, financial modeling, and machine learning. The fundamental challenge, recovering hidden causes from observed data, is inherently ill-posed and demands advanced mathematical techniques to ensure stability and interpretability of solutions.

This seminar aims to provide a cutting-edge survey of current developments in inverse problems, highlighting the interplay between rigorous theory, algorithmic innovation, and real-world applications. Participants will gain both conceptual insights and practical knowledge of state-of-the-art approaches. Topics will include:
1. Theoretical analysis of inverse problems
2. Regularization theory and optimization
3. Bayesian and statistical frameworks
4. Machine learning-based methods

To foster engagement and discussion, the seminar will follow this structure:
1. **Frequency.** Bi-weekly sessions (30-60 minutes)
2. **Structure.** Main presentation followed by 5-10 minutes of open discussion
3. **Mode.** Online

**Organizers.** [Pu-Zhao Kow](https://puzhaokow1993.github.io/homepage/), Ping Liu, [Suman Kumar Sahoo](https://sites.google.com/view/suman-sahoo-math-inverse), [Yaohua Zang](https://yaohua32.github.io/)
